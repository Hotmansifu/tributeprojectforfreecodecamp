      the "National Youth Administration"
    </li>
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money.
      Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
      Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
      scars on me."
    </li >
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the
      US Forestry Service
    </li>
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson.
      Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman,
      he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about
      breeding pest-resistent plants.
    </li>
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the
      Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked
      his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria,
      disinfectants, and other applied science.
    </li>
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant
      Pathology
    </li>
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
      leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new
      plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds
      6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including
      different varieties for each major climate on Earth.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
      season, doubling wheat yields
    </li>
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
      with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
      well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
    </li >
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
      strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
      mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
    </li>
    <li ::marker><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
    <li>
      <strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
      increase their maize and sorghum yields
    </li>

      A&amp;M University
    </li>
    <li ::marker>
      <strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world
      food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the
      only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says
      that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been
      genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
      before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
    </li>
   
    <li ::marker><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>

    <p>
      "I‘m announcing our final opperation! All Troops, line up! We will be doing a cavalry charge. Our goal: To rush the Beast Titan. Of course, we‘ll be making ourselves ideal targets. So we‘ll be wait until he‘s ready to throw and fire our smoke signals together. That should reduce his accuracy somewhat. While we‘re acting as a decoy Captain Levi will kill the Beast Titan. That is our plan. Standing and waiting just means we‘ll be showered by more boulders. Get ready on the double! Cadet: Are we all… heading… to our deaths? Yes. Cadet: If we‘re gonna die anyways, you‘re saying it‘s better… if we die fighting? Yes. Wait… if we‘re gonna die anyways, no matter how we die, even if it‘s disobeying orders, it all means nothing, right? You‘re precisely right. It‘s all meaningless. No matter what dreams or hopes you had… No matter how blessed a life you‘ve lived… It‘s all the same if you‘re shattered by rocks. Everyone will day someday. Does that mean life is meaningless? Was there even any meaning in our being born? Would you say that to our fallen comrades? Their lifes… Were they meaningless? No they weren‘t! It‘s us who gives meaning to our comrade‘s lives! The brave fallen! The anguished fallen! The ones who will remember them… are us, the living! We die trusting the living who follow to find meaning in our lives! That is the sole method in which we can rebel against this cruel world! My soldiers, rage! My soldiers, scream! My soldiers, fight!."
